To be honest, it is usually a tough work for a person to draw a blue script for himself or herself when the teenager
first set foot on the social preparatory period which is the collage, even he or she has experienced two years of study
time.

I made the decision to study IELTS to prepare for studying abroad and join a nascent lab of my school to challenge and
inspire the feeble soul of myself.

Advanced knowledge are learned and so many familiar pieces in the depths of my brain are raised in this summer, from the
visible HTML to the remote Git, and from the frame-oriented Vue.js to the object-oriented Java.
